# Introduction

Boba is clearly the best dessert drink in the world, but what is the best boba in the world? Here is one dude's quest for that truth. 

I prefer Jasmine Milk Tea / Green Milk Tea with boba and less sugar. To standardize my samples from different contenders, I'll stick with this order. My reviews will (for now) disregard some key factors that other boba reviewers sometimes opt for, such as price, flavor selection, or wait time. 

All my ratings are normalized to a full-score 10 in all categories for the best holistic boba drink I've ever had: **Boba Guys** in San Francisco, CA.

- Comments: Ordered a green milk tea w/ boba, less sugar. It could have used a bit more sweetener. The flavor was not as *fresh* as I look for in a boba, but not bad.

- Comments: Ordered a classic milk green tea w/ boba, 50% sugar. It's a little on the sweet side. Boba is pretty good, but could be a little chewier. Great tea flavor. Decor was cute and there was no line.

- Comments: Ordered a Fresh Milk Tea with Green Tea, Whole Milk, Boba, and half sugar. Definitely should have gone for 75% sugar. Overall, not super impressed, but one thing that stood out was the great boba. Perfect texture and just the right touch of sweetness from the boba.
