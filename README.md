# Introduction

Boba is clearly the best dessert drink in the world, but what is the best boba in the world? Here is one dude's quest for that truth. 

I prefer Jasmine Milk Tea / Green Milk Tea with boba and less sugar. To standardize my samples from different contenders, I'll stick with this order. My reviews will (for now) disregard some key factors that other boba reviewers sometimes opt for, such as price, flavor selection, or wait time. 

All my ratings are normalized to a full-score 10 in all categories for the best holistic boba drink I've ever had: **Boba Guys** in San Francisco, CA.

- Comments: Ordered a green milk tea w/ boba, less sugar. It could have used a bit more sweetener. The flavor was not as *fresh* as I look for in a boba, but not bad.

- Comments: Ordered a classic milk green tea w/ boba, 50% sugar. It's a little on the sweet side. Boba is pretty good, but could be a little chewier. Great tea flavor. Decor was cute and there was no line.

- Comments: Ordered a Fresh Milk Tea with Green Tea, Whole Milk, Boba, and half sugar. Definitely should have gone for 75% sugar. Overall, not super impressed, but one thing that stood out was the great boba. Perfect texture and just the right touch of sweetness from the boba.

- Comments: Ordered a Green Milk Tea with Boba, 50% sweet. I always see a huge line for this place, so thought I'd pull the trigger and check it out. Unfortunately, I was not super impressed. The boba was actual white boba, and I've noticed that most white boba (this drink included) just doesn't have that perfect chewy texture that great (brown sugar) boba can have. The tea was decent but I'd definitely bump up the order to 75% sweet next time. Overall, I don't understand the hype, but it was definitely an alright boba.

- Comments: "*Panda Express* has boba?!" My reaction as well... I tried a green milk tea with boba, 50% sweet. Surprisingly, the tea wasn't what you would expect from fast food boba. Overall I was very pleasantly surprised! But oh man, was it sweet. I think bumping the order down to no sugar could have been fine. The drink was honestly better than the equivalent at Quickly's or other fast boba chains. Dare I say... I might be back?

- Comments: Ordered a Jasmine Milk Tea with Boba, 50% sweet. The tea was alright, the fresh milk and sweetner was decent, and the boba was pretty amazing. Overall, I'd say that this cafe was more known for their snows and fruit creations - but their boba was pretty solid overall.

- Comments: Ordered an iced Jasmine Milk Tea with Honey Boba, 50% sweet. Their sweetener / tea here is SUPER interesting - massive herbal flavors. I've never had another drink like this before. The boba was decent (texture was alright, but the honey was great). Overall, a super unique take on the drink.
